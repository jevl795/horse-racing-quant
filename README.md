An algorithm for predicting horse races.
This code takes in a Past Performance data file (Brisnet), reads the data, analyzes it, and spits out a final prediciton for the finishing places for each horse.
Currently I am trying to figure out what the optimized coefficients are for each variable, multivariable linear regression is the path I am trying right now.
